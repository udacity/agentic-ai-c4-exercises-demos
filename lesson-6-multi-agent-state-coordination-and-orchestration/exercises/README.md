# Multi-Agent State Coordination and Orchestration Exercises

This directory contains exercises focused on coordinating state across multiple agents through effective orchestration patterns.

## Exercise Overview

In these exercises, you'll learn advanced techniques for state coordination in multi-agent systems by:

1. Implementing state synchronization across interdependent agents
2. Creating coordination patterns for complex multi-step workflows
3. Building resilient systems that can recover from failures
4. Managing transactions across distributed agent components

## Key Concepts

- State synchronization patterns
- Multi-step workflow coordination
- Resilience and recovery mechanisms
- Distributed transaction management

## Exercise Structure

The exercises provide scaffolding code that you'll extend to create sophisticated state coordination systems:
