        Hi everyone, welcome to the course on Multi-Agent Systems. 2025 is the year of the agent, 
        and there is no better time than now to start so that you can transform your workflows with AI. 
        Many of us have a good understanding of how to solve problems in uncertain situations in our jobs, 
        and multi-agent systems allow us to structure these abstract processes
         so we can mainly focus on tweaking and editing natural language prompts instead of worrying about 
         figuring out exact formulas or algorithms or dealing with messy data or confusing and complicated connections to disparate systems.

        By the end of the course, you'll be able to design and develop complex multi agent systems that can carry
         out multi-step procedures to ensure requests are satisfied. In so doing, you'll be able to determine 
         agentic solutions for your own workflows that allow you to focus on more creative tasks like
         building systems and out-of-the-box ideas!

        What is a multi agent system?  A multi-agent system is a computational program which can receive 
        complicated natural language requests from users and respond agentically, that is, that there is
         not a strictly defined pre-determined sequence of checks that an agent will go through in responding 
         to a user question. In a multi-agent system, by defining agents with distinct goals and personalities,
          we can begin to approximate the kind of interactivity that occurs between humans working on a problem.

        [DIAGRAM: A flowchart showing a multi-agent system. A user connects to a coordinator agent with a 
        bidirectional "request/response" arrow. The coordinator has a decision loop that branches to either 
        use tools directly or delegate to specialized agents. These specialized agents (shown as 3-4 separate boxes)
         have access to various tools (database, search, code execution). Arrows show communication flow between components.]
  - slide:
      title: "Motivating story/scenario"
      script: |
        Let's start with a simple example everyone can relate to. Think about how a restaurant operates. You have:
        - Hosts who greet customers and manage seating
        - Waiters who take orders and deliver food
        - Chefs who specialize in different types of cooking
        - Managers who oversee the whole operation
        - Busboys who clean up when customers leave

        Each person has a clear role, and they communicate with each other to deliver a complete experience.
        Multi-agent AI systems work in a similar way and we can extend this thought process to essentially any
        kind of business system that operates based on well defined roles and responsibilities.

        [repeat the diagram from the first slide but instead of abstract agents and tools, fill it out so its like these]

      title: "Conceptual Framework (Optional)"
      script: |
        To make mutli-agent systems truly powerful and groundbreaking, we need to make sure that that 
        the agents themselves can integrate with uot business systems. This requires us to enable them
        with complex tools and so in this course we will learn about how to route data and memories
        between agents and how to use agents to more carefully augment requests to AI models with relevant context.

        [show a diagram of agent system where there are links between the system and a db stack, a web search indicator,
        and then a code execution thing that will have like a python (>>>) symbol/ a bash ($) symbol]

        When agents can use tools to experiment and to verify claims, we can see clearly that hallucinations
        will be reduced and overall user satisfaction will improve.

      title: "Module 1: Multi-Agent Architecture Design"
      script: |
        Now that we've got an introduction under our belts for agents, let's talk about how to actually design a multi-agent 
        system. Think of this as drawing up the blueprint for a team: who does what, how do they talk to each other, 
        and what are the rules of engagement? We'll look at common patterns like having a central orchestrator who delegates 
        tasks to worker agents, or using specialized agents for different types of information retrieval. 
        The key is to define clear roles and responsibilities, and to map out how data will flow between agents. 
        We'll also introduce some diagramming tools you can use to visualize your system before you start building.

        [DIAGRAM: An architecture blueprint showing common multi-agent patterns. The left side shows an "Orchestrator-Worker" 
        pattern with a central manager connected to multiple specialized workers. The right side shows a "Peer-to-Peer" pattern where
        specialized agents connect directly to each other in a mesh. In the former, all communication flows through a central agent, whereas in the latter, communication 
        begins directly with individual agents who can decide to pass things along to others in the network.
        Arrows indicate message passing between components. 
        Labels highlight key design considerations like "Role Definition", "Communication Protocol", and "State Management".]

  - slide:
      title: "Multi-Agent Architecture Design: Component Patterns"
      script: |
        In this section, we're focusing on the fundamental components that make a multi-agent system work effectively. 
        You'll learn to identify the essential building blocks and understand how to design architectures where 
        agents collaborate efficiently. Think of it like organizing a team where each member has specific responsibilities.

        There are a few different approaches to structuring these systems. As mentioned before, you might use an orchestrator 
        pattern, where a central coordinator directs specialized workers, similar to how a project manager delegates tasks. 
        Or you could implement direct routing, where requests immediately go to the most qualified agent for handling. 
        We'll explore how information flows through these different structures and why specialization leads to more robust outcomes.

        Let's look at an e-commerce return system as an example. When a customer submits a return request,
        the orchestrator receives it and activates the right specialists - a policy agent checks eligibility requirements, an inventory agent prepares stock updates, a refund agent processes the payment return, and a communication agent keeps the customer informed throughout. This approach ensures each specialized function is handled by an agent specifically designed for that task, creating a seamless experience despite the complex coordination happening behind the scenes.
- slide:
      title: "Multi-Agent Architecture Design: Implementation Frameworks"
      script: |
        As you go through the implementation frameworks, think about how you might adapt these patterns to your own projects.
        
        For our demo example, we'll build a healthcare diagnostic system where medical information flows between specialists. 
        Picture a primary diagnostic agent that first assesses patient symptoms, then routes complex cases to specialized 
        agents representing different medical domains - cardiology, neurology, and internal medicine. 
        Each specialist agent applies domain-specific reasoning and returns findings to a synthesis agent that compiles a 
        comprehensive diagnostic report. This framework illustrates how appropriate architecture selection dramatically 
        improves the system's ability to handle complex, specialized knowledge domains.

        Now it's your turn! Choose a real-world scenario—maybe a sales pipeline, a marketing funnel, 
        or a multi-step helpdesk process. Draw a multi-agent architecture diagram for your scenario. 
        Clearly present the roles of each agent and show how data flows between them. 
        Think about which agents would be responsible for specific tasks and how they would communicate with each other.

        Here's our helpdesk architecture solution:

        [DIAGRAM: A flowchart showing the helpdesk multi-agent system with four connected components.
         The Orchestrator Agent is at the center with arrows connecting to three specialized agents: 
         Classification Agent (top), Knowledge Agent (right), and Response Agent (bottom). 
         Arrows show the data flow between components, with user input entering the Orchestrator and the final 
         response coming from the Response Agent.]

        The diagram illustrates our straightforward multi-agent system with four specialized components:
        
        The Orchestrator Agent receives user queries and coordinates the workflow between the other agents.
        When a query arrives, it's sent to the Classification Agent, which analyzes the issue type. 
        Based on this classification, the Knowledge Agent retrieves relevant documentation.
        Finally, the Response Agent creates a helpful answer by combining the classification and knowledge.
        
        This modular design keeps each agent focused on one responsibility, making the system easy to understand and extend.
        The visual representation helps us see how data flows through the system and how each component interacts with others.

        Once you've designed your architecture, it's time to bring it to life in code. In this section, we'll 
        show you how to instantiate multiple agents in your codebase and connect them with well-defined interfaces. 
        You'll learn how to define each agent's system prompt or specialized toolset, so that each one knows exactly 
        what it's responsible for. By the end, you'll have a working multi-agent system that can handle complex tasks
        by dividing the work among specialized agents.

        [DIAGRAM: A code structure visualization showing agent implementation. The left side shows "Agent Definition" 
        with a base agent class and specialized subclasses. The middle shows "Communication" with message objects and 
        interface definitions. The right shows "Tools Integration" with specialized tools assigned to different agents.

        Moving from architecture design to implementation requires translating our conceptual models into working code. 
        You'll develop a multi-agent system by coding the architecture we designed in the previous section, creating clear 
        interfaces for communication and collaboration. The implementation process involves instantiating multiple agents 
        in a single codebase, each with their own specialized role and toolset.

        We'll explore how to implement agent classes that reflect the architectural patterns we discussed earlier. 
        This includes crafting system prompts that define each agent's specialized knowledge, assigning appropriate
        tools to each agent, and establishing protocols for passing messages between them. The state management 
        concepts we touched on in our architectural designs will become concrete implementation details that make 
        our agents persistent and reliable.
        
        For our demo, we'll implement a content creation workflow system that builds on the architectural patterns 
        we've explored. We'll create specialized agents for content research, writing, editing, and publishing -a practical 
        application of the role specialization concept. The research agent specializes in finding and analyzing information,
        using web search and data analysis tools. The writing agent transforms that research into engaging content, 
        while the editing agent applies style and grammar rules. Finally, the publishing agent handles formatting and distribution. 
        This demonstrates how the modular architecture we designed translates into a functioning system where each agent excels 
        at its specific responsibility while working toward a shared goal.

      title: "Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation: Communication Protocols"

        We'll focus on implementing clean interfaces between agents and covering different methods for agents to 
        exchange information. You'll learn how to structure agent classes, integrate tools, handle messages, and manage state.
        
        For our demo, let's build a financial advisory system where different agents must exchange structured data. 
        Our system consists of a client-facing advisor agent, a market analysis agent, a portfolio optimization agent, 
        and a regulatory compliance agent. We'll implement a standardized JSON message protocol between these agents, 
        allowing them to exchange complex financial data like portfolio compositions, market trends, and investment recommendations.
         When a client asks about retirement planning, the advisor agent structures the request into a standard format, 
         sends it to the specialized agents, and then synthesizes their responses. This structured communication ensures 
         that complex financial concepts are accurately translated between agents without information loss.

        Here's our content curation system implementation:

        [DIAGRAM: A flowchart showing three connected agent functions. The finder_agent (left) connects to 
        curator_agent (middle), which connects to formatter_agent (right), with data flowing left to right.
        The process_request function wraps around all three, showing the orchestration flow.]

        ```python
        # Basic agent implementation
        def finder_agent(topic):
            print(f"Finding content about: {topic}")
            # This would search for relevant content
            return ["Article about AI", "Video about machine learning"]

        def curator_agent(content_list):
            print(f"Curating content...")
            # This would filter content by relevance
            return content_list[0]  # Just return the first item

        def formatter_agent(content):
            print(f"Formatting: {content}")
            # This would improve presentation
            return f"Formatted: {content}"

        # Simple orchestration
        def process_request(topic):
            print(f"Processing request about: {topic}")
            
            # Step 1: Find content
            content = finder_agent(topic)
            
            # Step 2: Curate content
            best_content = curator_agent(content)
            
            # Step 3: Format content
            final_content = formatter_agent(best_content)
            
            return final_content
        ```

        [ANIMATION: A simple animation showing data flowing through the pipeline - a search query enters the finder, multiple results flow to the curator, one selected result flows to the formatter, and a polished final result emerges.]

        This implementation shows the core idea - breaking down a complex task into simple agents, each with a specific responsibility. The finder gets content, the curator picks the best, and the formatter makes it look nice. Then we just string these together in sequence to handle the whole task.

      title: "Module 4: Orchestrating Agent Activities"
      script: |
        Now that you have multiple agents working together, the next challenge is to coordinate their activities. 
        Think of this as being the conductor of an orchestra—each agent has its part to play, 
        but they need to stay in sync for the performance to work. We'll cover how to synchronize agent states, 
        resolve conflicts, and make sure each agent's progress is consistent before moving on to the next step. 
        This is where orchestration and state coordination come into play.

        [DIAGRAM: An orchestration flow chart showing a central "Orchestrator" node connected to multiple worker agents.
        The diagram shows three key orchestration patterns: sequential execution (agents in a chain), parallel execution (multiple agents working simultaneously), and conditional branching (decision points that route to different agents). Arrows show message flow between components, with state data being passed back to the orchestrator after each agent completes its task.]
  - slide:
      title: "Orchestrating Agent Activities: Workflow Patterns"
      script: |
        Now that we've implemented our agent architecture, we need to focus on how these agents work together
        in coordinated workflows. Orchestration is all about applying techniques that direct and manage agent 
        interactions to achieve complex goals. This builds directly on the implementation patterns we just explored,
        taking those individual agents and creating both sequential and parallel execution patterns to handle 
        different types of tasks efficiently.

        The orchestration layer needs to be designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to expand your system 
        with additional agents as your requirements grow. This involves creating an orchestrator agent that can delegate 
        tasks appropriately, handle agent responses, manage errors when they occur, and incorporate new capabilities 
        without redesigning the entire system.
        

        We'll discuss how to implement an orchestrator agent, delegate tasks, handle agent responses, 
        manage errors and recovery, and add new agents to your architecture as your needs grow.
        
        For our demo, we'll build an automated customer support system that handles technical troubleshooting. 
        Our orchestrator agent first receives the customer issue and determines what type of problem it is. 
        For a wifi connectivity issue, it creates a sequential workflow: first delegating to a diagnostic agent that 
        checks connection status, then to a solution agent that generates step-by-step instructions, 
        and finally to a verification agent that confirms the solution worked. This sequential pattern ensures each 
        step builds on the previous results. The orchestrator tracks the state of the interaction, handling cases 
        where a step fails and alternative solutions need to be explored. This demonstrates how proper orchestration 
        can manage complex workflows while maintaining a coherent user experience.

  - slide:
      title: "Orchestrating Agent Activities: Error Handling & Recovery"
      script: |
        For our demo, we'll implement a travel planning system that must handle unexpected changes gracefully. 
        Our orchestrator agent coordinates booking flights, hotels, and activities for a vacation. 
        When a flight cancellation occurs, our error handling pattern kicks in - the orchestrator detects the failure, 
        pauses the hotel and activity booking agents, and activates a flight rebooking agent to find alternatives. 
        Once a new flight is secured, the orchestrator updates the timing parameters for the other agents and resumes 
        their operation with the modified schedule. This demonstrates how robust error handling in an orchestrator can 
        maintain system coherence even when parts of a workflow fail, providing users with resilient experiences 
        despite real-world complications.

        Let's put orchestration into practice. Build a multi-agent system with a central orchestrator that collects

        ```python
        # Simple support agents
        def diagnose(issue):
            print(f"Diagnosing: {issue}")
            if "wifi" in issue.lower():
                return "WiFi connection problem"

            # Step 1: Diagnose the problem
            diagnosis = diagnose(user_request)
            
            # Step 2: Find a solution
            solution = find_solution(diagnosis)
            
            # Step 3: Verify the solution works
            verification = verify_solution(solution)
            
            return {
                "issue": user_request,
                "diagnosis": diagnosis,
                "solution": solution,
                "verification": verification
            }
        ```

        [ANIMATION: A sequence showing data transformation through the workflow. 
        A user's "My WiFi isn't working" request enters the system, transforms into a "WiFi connection problem" diagnosis,

        This solution shows a simple orchestration system with three specialized functions that handle different 
        parts of the support process. The orchestrator function coordinates them in sequence, 
        passing the output of each step as input to the next. This demonstrates the core idea of orchestration: 
        breaking a complex process into simple steps and managing the flow between them.

      script: |
        Now that we've established how to orchestrate agent activities, let's tackle another 
        crucial aspect of multi-agent systems: how data actually moves between agents. 
        Effective routing mechanisms ensure the right information reaches the right agent
        at the right time, which is essential for complex workflows to function correctly.

        Think of routing like a sophisticated mail delivery system. Based on various 
        properties of a message - its content, metadata, priority, or source - we need to 
        make intelligent decisions about where it should go next. In this section, we'll 
        explore different routing strategies and how to implement them in a multi-agent 
        environment.

        [DIAGRAM: A data flow diagram showing message routing between agents. The central 
        component is a "Router" that contains decision logic. Multiple message types (shown 
        as different colored envelopes) flow into the router, which examines properties and 
        directs them to appropriate agent endpoints. Decision nodes show different routing 
        patterns: content-based routing, round-robin distribution, and priority-based queuing. 
        Arrows show message flow with metadata labels attached to each path.]
  - slide:
      title: "Routing and Data Flow in Agentic Systems: Routing Strategies"
      script: |
        When building multi-agent systems, deciding how messages and data flow between 
        components is critical to system performance and reliability. Let's explore several 
        routing patterns that you can implement in your own systems.

        Content-based routing examines the message content itself to determine where it 
        should go. For instance, queries about pricing might route to a pricing specialist 
        agent, while technical questions route to a support agent. This approach ensures 
        messages reach the most qualified handler.

        Round-robin distribution spreads workload evenly across similar agents, which is 
        useful when you have multiple instances of the same agent type and want to balance 
        processing load. Priority-based routing ensures critical messages are handled before 
        less important ones, creating a responsive system even under heavy load.

        For our demo, we'll implement a customer service system with intelligent routing. 
        When messages arrive, our router analyzes the content using keyword detection and 
        sentiment analysis. Technical queries route to technical support agents, billing 
        questions go to account specialists, and urgent messages with negative sentiment 
        receive priority handling. This ensures customers get the most qualified help 
        without needing to navigate a complex decision tree themselves. Our router tracks 
        agent load and response times, adjusting routing decisions dynamically to maintain 
        consistent service levels even during peak demand.
  - slide:
      title: "Routing and Data Flow in Agentic Systems: Data Flow Management"
      script: |
        Managing data flow effectively is essential in complex multi-agent systems. Beyond just 
        deciding where messages should go, we need to consider how data transforms as it moves 
        through our system.

        At each step of a multi-agent workflow, information may need to be enhanced, filtered, 
        or reformatted for the next agent in the chain. Think of this as a pipeline where each 
        component processes data into the exact format needed downstream. These transformations 
        must be carefully designed to avoid information loss or distortion.

        For our demo, we'll implement a news aggregation system with sophisticated data flow 
        management. When a user requests news about a specific topic, a classification agent 
        first determines the relevant categories and keywords. This structured metadata is 
        passed to multiple source agents (social media, news sites, academic publications) 
        that each return content in their own format. A normalization agent then transforms 
        these disparate formats into a standardized schema, preserving source-specific 
        attributes while creating consistency. Finally, a personalization agent tailors the 
        presentation based on user preferences. This pipeline demonstrates how each agent adds 
        value to the data flow while maintaining compatibility with the next stage in the 
        process.

        As agents interact over multiple turns, keeping track of state becomes essential. 
        Think of it like keeping a detailed logbook for a team project—everyone needs to know what 
        has happened so far and what still needs to be done. In this section, 
        you'll learn how to track and update agent state across multi-turn interactions, handle errors or re-requests, 
        and distinguish between temporary and persistent data.

        We'll cover advanced state management, including conversation-level state versus system-level state, and 
        strategies for handling partial errors or re-requests.

        [DIAGRAM: A comprehensive state management diagram with two main sections. The left shows "Conversation State" 
        (ephemeral) with a chat history and short-term memory component. The right shows "System State" (persistent) 
        with a database connection. The middle shows state transitions between conversations, including save/load operations 
        and recovery points. Arrows indicate how state flows between components and across sessions.

      title: "State Management in Multi-Agent Systems: Recovery Mechanisms"
      script: |
        For our demo, we'll implement a real-time collaborative document editing system with robust recovery mechanisms. 
        Multiple users might be editing different sections of a document simultaneously, with each edit handled by specialized agent workers. 
        Our recovery system maintains a transaction log of all edits with periodic checkpoints of the document state. 
        If a user's connection drops mid-edit, our recovery agent automatically detects the failure, rolls back to the last 
        consistent state for that section, and preserves all other users' changes. When the user reconnects, they see exactly
        where they left off with minimal disruption. This demonstrates how effective recovery mechanisms can maintain system
        integrity even when parts of a distributed system fail unexpectedly, providing resilience without compromising the
        user experience or losing valuable work.

      title: "State Management in Multi-Agent Systems: Persistence Strategies"
      script: |
        Building on our exploration of agent coordination, let's focus on how systems remember what they've learned. 
        State management is crucial for creating systems that maintain context across interactions. 
        You need ways to track and update what each agent knows, distinguishing between temporary information that can be discarded 
        and critical data that must be preserved.

        The challenge is similar to what we encountered in our orchestration examples, but with a focus on data persistence 
        rather than just workflow. We need to manage both conversation-level state (what's happening right now) and system-level 
        state (what should be remembered for the future). When failures happen - and they will - having robust recovery strategies 
        ensures your system can pick up where it left off.
        
        For our demo, let's build an educational tutoring system that maintains student progress across sessions. 
        Our system uses a state persistence strategy that tracks what concepts a student has mastered, what they're struggling with, 
        and their learning preferences. When a student starts a new tutoring session about algebra, the system loads their persistent 
        state from a database, allowing the tutor agent to continue exactly where they left off. The state includes detailed information
        like which specific algebraic concepts (e.g., quadratic equations) they've mastered and which ones they need more 
        practice with. If the tutoring session is interrupted, our persistence layer ensures all progress is saved, allowing 
        seamless resumption later. This persistent state model demonstrates how proper state management creates personalized, 
        continuous experiences even across disconnected interactions.

        Here's a simple state management solution for a tutoring system:

        [DIAGRAM: A flow chart showing state management in a tutoring system. At the top is a "user_states" database. 
        Three main functions connect to it: save_state (writes data), load_state (reads data), and 
        update_progress (reads, modifies, writes). Two session functions, start_session and end_session, 
        act as wrappers around the core functions. Arrows show the data flow between components.]

        ```python
        # Simple dictionary to store user states
        user_states = {}

        # Functions to save and load state
        def save_state(user_id, state):
            user_states[user_id] = state
            print(f"Saved state for user {user_id}")

        def load_state(user_id):
            if user_id in user_states:
                print(f"Loaded state for user {user_id}")
                return user_states[user_id]
            else:
                print(f"No state found for user {user_id}")
                return {"new_user": True, "mastered_topics": []}

        # Tutoring system functions
        def start_session(user_id):
            # Load previous state if it exists
            return load_state(user_id)

        def end_session(user_id, state):
            # Save state for future sessions
            save_state(user_id, state)

        def update_progress(user_id, topic, mastered):
            # Update the user's progress
            state = load_state(user_id)
            
            if mastered and topic not in state["mastered_topics"]:
                state["mastered_topics"].append(topic)
                
            save_state(user_id, state)
            return state
        ```

        [ANIMATION: A timeline showing the persistence of state across separate sessions. 
        First, a student learns algebra, and the state is saved. Then a system crash occurs (shown as a lightning bolt). 
        Finally, a new session begins and the previous state is successfully restored, showing the student's progress is preserved.]
        # Student learns algebra
        update_progress("student123", "algebra", True)
        end_session("student123", state)
        
        # Simulate system crash
        print("System crashed!")
        
        # Next session - state should persist
        print("\nStarting second session...")
        state = start_session("student123")
        print(f"Student has already mastered: {state['mastered_topics']}")
        ```

        This simple solution shows how to maintain state between sessions. 
        We're just using a dictionary to store user states, but in a real system this would be a database. 
        The key concept is saving state at the end of each session and loading it at the beginning of the next one. 
        This way, even if the system crashes, we don't lose information about what the student has learned.

        When multiple agents are working together, it's crucial to keep their states in sync. 
        Imagine a relay race—each runner needs to know when to start and when to pass the baton.
        In this section, you'll learn how to develop coordinated multi-agent systems that synchronize states
        for coherent task execution. We'll cover state synchronization protocols, conflict resolution strategies, 
        and how to verify that each agent's progress is consistent before moving on.

        [DIAGRAM: A state coordination system showing multiple agents and a central coordination mechanism. 
        The diagram features agent states as colored boxes (each with internal state variables), 
        connected to a central "State Broker" that manages synchronization. 
        Dotted lines show state update messages flowing between components. 
        A "Conflict Detection" module highlights areas where agent states conflict, 
        and a "Resolution Logic" component shows how conflicts are addressed. A timeline at the 
        bottom illustrates how states stay synchronized across time steps in the system.]

  - slide:
      title: "Multi-Agent State Coordination & Orchestration: Synchronization Protocols"
      script: |
        Taking what we've learned about state management and orchestration, we now need to focus on
        keeping multiple agents' states coordinated. This synchronization challenge combines concepts 
        from both areas we've previously explored. When numerous agents operate simultaneously, 
        they must share a consistent understanding of the world state.

        Developing a robust synchronization protocol requires careful design decisions about how data 
        is shared, when it's updated, and how to handle conflicts. Remember our tutoring system example? 
        Now imagine scaling that to dozens of tutors working together with shared students. 
        We need mechanisms to detect when one agent's knowledge contradicts another's, and clear rules 
        for resolving those conflicts.
        
        For our demo, we'll build a distributed supply chain management system where multiple agents need 
        synchronized information. Our system includes a warehouse inventory agent, a logistics agent 
        planning deliveries, a demand forecasting agent, and a procurement agent for ordering new stock. 
        The synchronization protocol ensures that when inventory levels change, all agents receive consistent updates.
        For example, when a large order depletes stock of a popular item, our inventory agent broadcasts this state 
        change to all other agents. The logistics agent adjusts delivery schedules, the forecasting agent updates 
        future demand predictions, and the procurement agent places expedited restocking orders. 
        Our synchronization protocol includes timestamp-based versioning to resolve conflicts when multiple updates
        happen simultaneously, ensuring all agents operate on a consistent view of the supply chain status.

      title: "Multi-Agent State Coordination & Orchestration: Conflict Resolution"
      script: |
        For our demo, we'll implement an autonomous vehicle traffic coordination system where conflict resolution is 
        critical. Multiple vehicle agents need to navigate an intersection safely without collisions. 
        Each vehicle agent maintains its own state (position, speed, direction), but conflicting intentions can arise - 
        for example, two vehicles might both plan to occupy the same space at the same time. O
        Our conflict resolution system detects these potential collisions using a shared traffic coordination agent 
        that compares the projected paths of all vehicles. When a conflict is detected, it applies 
        resolution rules (right-of-way protocols, speed adjustments) and communicates updated plans to 
        the affected vehicles. This demonstrates how proper conflict resolution prevents system failures in 
        scenarios where independent agents with their own objectives must coordinate in a shared environment.

        vehicles["car2"] = create_vehicle("car2", (0, 1), (2, 1))

        for step in range(3):
            print(f"\nStep {step}")
            simulation_step()
        ```

        This simple solution shows how a coordinator can:
        1. Detect when two agents plan to do something that conflicts 
        2. Resolve the conflict by adjusting one agent's plan
        3. Keep all agents moving toward their goals safely

        Instead of complex classes, we're using basic dictionaries and functions to demonstrate the core concept. The coordinator checks for conflicts before each step, resolves them with a simple rule (first vehicle waits), and then allows safe movement.

      title: "Module 7: Multi-Agent Retrieval Augmented Generation"
      script: |
        Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for combining search and generation. 
        In a multi-agent context, we can extend RAG by having multiple cooperating agents, each specialized 
        in certain retrieval tasks. This allows us to orchestrate multi-step retrieval processes and 
        synthesize information from multiple sources, making our systems even more capable and reliable.

        We'll cover how to use multi-agent tool usage for retrieval and how to orchestrate multi-step retrieval workflows.

        [DIAGRAM: A multi-agent RAG architecture showing specialized retrieval agents on the 
        left (Scientific Literature Agent, News Agent, Database Agent, and Web Search Agent),

        that manages requests to these agents. On the right is a "Synthesis Agent" that combines 
        information from multiple sources. Arrows show how user queries flow through the system, 
        with dotted lines representing optional follow-up queries when information gaps are detected.

      title: "Multi-Agent Retrieval Augmented Generation: Specialized Information Agents"
      script: |
        Now let's explore how we can apply what we've learned about agent coordination to enhance traditional 
        RAG systems. Standard retrieval augmented generation is powerful, but by adding multiple specialized 
        agents to the mix, we can dramatically improve the quality and reliability of information.

        Building on our earlier discussions about agent specialization and state coordination, 
        we can create information agents with distinct knowledge domains. Each agent becomes an expert 
        in retrieving and interpreting specific types of information, similar to how we separated 
        responsibilities in our architecture examples. This specialization allows for deeper expertise 
        while the orchestration techniques we've explored help manage the multi-step retrieval process.
        
        For our demo, we'll build a scientific research assistant that leverages specialized information agents. 
        When a researcher asks "What are the latest developments in CRISPR for treating cystic fibrosis?", 
        our system activates multiple specialized retrieval agents. A scientific literature agent searches 
        academic databases for peer-reviewed papers, a medical trials agent finds ongoing clinical studies, 
        a news agent retrieves recent biotech announcements, and a regulatory agent checks FDA approvals. 
        Each agent not only retrieves information but also provides context - the literature agent highlights
        methodology limitations, while the trials agent notes patient outcomes. A synthesis agent then combines
        these specialized insights into a comprehensive research briefing that presents a much richer picture 
        than any single retrieval source could provide.

      title: "Multi-Agent Retrieval Augmented Generation: Information Synthesis Workflows"
      script: |
        For our demo, we'll implement a legal discovery system for complex litigation cases. 
        When an attorney needs to build a case around intellectual property infringement, our system coordinates multiple specialized retrieval agents in a multi-step workflow. First, a patent search agent retrieves all relevant patents and their technical details. Then, a case law agent finds precedent cases with similar technology disputes. A corporate research agent gathers information about the defendant's product development timeline. Finally, a document analysis agent scans internal documents for mentions of the technology. What makes this system powerful is its synthesis workflow - after initial retrieval, a gap analysis agent identifies missing information areas and triggers targeted follow-up searches. The final legal analysis agent then creates a comprehensive report connecting technical patent details with specific evidence of infringement, presenting a thoroughly researched argument backed by information from multiple specialized sources.

        This straightforward solution shows the core concept of multi-agent RAG:
        
        1. We have specialized functions for different types of information
        2. We start with basic information and then check for gaps
        3. We fill those gaps with targeted additional searches
        4. We synthesize everything into a comprehensive answer
        
        This approach is much more powerful than searching everything at once because it allows us to be selective about what we retrieve and make sure we're not missing critical information based on the specific question being asked.
