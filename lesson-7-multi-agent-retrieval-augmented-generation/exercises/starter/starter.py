EXERCISE: CLAIM FRAUD DETECTION WITH RAG

In this exercise, you'll enhance the insurance claims processing system by adding 
fraud detection capabilities powered by RAG. Fraud detection is a critical component 
of insurance claims processing, saving the industry billions of dollars annually.

Your task is to:

1. Implement a FraudDetectionAgent class that leverages RAG to identify potentially 
   fraudulent claims by comparing them with known fraud patterns
   
2. Create a fraud knowledge base with common fraud indicators and patterns
   
3. Implement vector search functionality to identify similar fraud patterns
   
4. Integrate the agent into the existing workflow, adding a fraud review step to the
   claim processing pipeline

HINTS:
- You can use the existing VectorKnowledgeBase and VectorClaimSearch as references
- Your fraud detection component should consider multiple factors like claim frequency,
  unusual patterns, and similarity to known fraud cases
- Make sure to respect the privacy levels and access controls already in place
