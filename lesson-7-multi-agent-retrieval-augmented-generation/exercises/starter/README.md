# Multi-Agent RAG System - Starter

This directory contains the starter code for the Multi-Agent Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) exercise. In this exercise, you will enhance an insurance claims processing system by adding fraud detection capabilities powered by RAG.

## Getting Started

The `starter.py` file contains the skeleton code you'll need to implement the fraud detection feature. It includes:

- Necessary imports and integration with the existing demo
- A structured exercise prompt about claim fraud detection
- Empty classes and function signatures that you need to implement
- Clear TODO comments guiding you through the implementation steps

## Your Task

You will implement a fraud detection component that uses retrieval-augmented generation to identify potentially fraudulent claims. Specifically, you will:

1. Create a knowledge base of common fraud patterns
2. Implement vector embeddings for similarity search
3. Build a FraudDetectionAgent that can analyze claims
4. Integrate your fraud detection into the existing workflow

Follow the TODOs in the starter code to complete the implementation. The comments will guide you through each step of the process.

## Running the Starter Code

To run the starter code:

```bash
python starter.py
```

Note that until you implement the required components, the code will not run successfully.

## Resources

For reference, check the demo implementation to understand how the existing insurance claims system works, particularly the vector similarity search and access control mechanisms.
