# Multi-Agent Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

In this lesson, we explore how Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance multi-agent systems by grounding agent responses in domain-specific knowledge. Traditional large language models (LLMs) may hallucinate or provide outdated information when tackling specialized tasks. By implementing RAG, we can augment our agents with access to accurate, up-to-date, and domain-specific information, enabling them to make better-informed decisions and provide more accurate responses.

Our insurance claims processing demo showcases a practical implementation of multi-agent RAG. In this system, specialized agents (customer service, medical review, and claims processing) work together to handle customer complaints about denied insurance claims. Each agent has access to relevant knowledge bases, including policy information, procedural codes, and historical claim data. Through vector similarity search and role-based access control, agents retrieve only the information relevant to their tasks and appropriate to their security clearance. This approach demonstrates how RAG systems can be effectively deployed in privacy-sensitive domains where information access must be carefully controlled.

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you will:
1. Explore the implementation of a multi-agent RAG system for insurance claim processing
2. Understand how vector embeddings enable semantic search across knowledge bases
3. Learn how to implement role-based access control in a RAG system
4. Extend the system with a new feature to improve its capabilities

By completing this exercise, you'll gain practical experience in building sophisticated multi-agent systems that leverage RAG to provide more accurate, context-aware, and privacy-conscious responses in specialized domains.
