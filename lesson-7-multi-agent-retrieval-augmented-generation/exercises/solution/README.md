# Multi-Agent RAG System - Solution

This directory contains the complete solution for the Multi-Agent Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) exercise. The solution demonstrates how to implement a fraud detection system for insurance claims using RAG techniques.

## Solution Overview

The `solution.py` file provides a full implementation of the fraud detection feature with:

- A knowledge base of common insurance fraud patterns with appropriate privacy levels
- A vector-based fraud pattern detector using TF-IDF embeddings and cosine similarity
- A hybrid approach combining vector similarity with rule-based fraud detection
- A dedicated FraudDetectionAgent with appropriate tools and access levels
- An enhanced orchestrator that integrates fraud detection into the workflow
- A demonstration function that processes both legitimate and suspicious claims

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

The solution showcases several important RAG concepts:

- Using vector embeddings to match claims against known fraud patterns
- Contextual retrieval by incorporating patient history in the fraud assessment
- Role-based information access that respects privacy levels
- Hybrid retrieval that combines vector similarity with rule-based approaches

## Running the Solution

To run the solution:

```bash
python solution.py
```

This will demonstrate the fraud detection capabilities by processing both a legitimate claim and a suspicious claim, showing how the system flags potential fraud.

## Further Exploration

After reviewing the solution, consider these ways to extend it:

1. Add more sophisticated fraud patterns and detection rules
2. Implement feedback loops to improve detection accuracy over time
3. Add explainability features that detail why a claim was flagged as suspicious
4. Explore using more advanced embedding techniques beyond TF-IDF
