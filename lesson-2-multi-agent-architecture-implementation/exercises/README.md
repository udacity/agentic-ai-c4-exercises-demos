# Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation Exercises

This directory contains exercises focused on implementing multi-agent architectures, moving from design to functional code.

## Exercise Overview

In these exercises, you'll transform architectural designs into working code by:

1. Implementing individual agents with well-defined roles and capabilities
2. Creating messaging systems for inter-agent communication
3. Establishing coordination mechanisms between agents
4. Testing the functionality of your multi-agent system

## Key Concepts

- Agent implementation patterns
- Message passing and communication protocols
- State management between agents
- Testing multi-agent systems

## Exercise Structure

The exercises provide scaffolding code that you'll extend to create functioning multi-agent systems:

```
