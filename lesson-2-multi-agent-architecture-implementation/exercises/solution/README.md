# Multi-Agent Resource Management Solution

Welcome to our enhanced Antarctic research station system! We've built a sophisticated multi-agent implementation that demonstrates real-world resource allocation and coordination patterns.

Our system features two primary agent types working together. The `ScientistAgent` serves as the central resource coordinator, managing food supplies and tool distribution while maintaining fairness across all penguin requests. The `PenguinAgent` represents individual entities with their own needs and decision-making capabilities.

What makes this implementation powerful is the integration of LLM-driven decision making. Both agent types use language models to reason about their situations - penguins evaluate their needs and formulate requests, while the scientist analyzes resource availability and distribution history to make fair allocation decisions.

The system includes sophisticated tracking mechanisms through our tool functions. The `check_history` tool allows agents to review past resource distributions, ensuring fairness over time. The `record_distribution` tool maintains a comprehensive log of all transactions, creating accountability and enabling analysis of system behavior patterns.

Our simulation runs in structured rounds, creating a realistic environment where resources are limited and agents must compete fairly. The scientist periodically refreshes resources, simulating real-world supply cycles, while penguins adapt their strategies based on their current state and past experiences.

The bidirectional communication between agents creates emergent behaviors - penguins learn to time their requests strategically, while the scientist develops consistent fairness policies. This multi-agent approach demonstrates how individual autonomous decisions can create stable, efficient resource management systems.

This solution showcases the power of agent-based modeling for complex coordination problems, providing a foundation for understanding how intelligent agents can work together to manage shared resources effectively.
