## Antarctic Agents: A Penguin-Scientist Demo

 Hello and welcome to today's coding adventure. We're going on a virtual trip to Antarctica, a place of extreme cold and amazing wildlife. Did you know that Emperor Penguins, the stars of our show today, can dive hundreds of meters deep and hold their breath for over twenty minutes? Amazing, right? They're incredibly adapted to survive in one of the harshest environments on Earth."

"We're going to use the power of AI agents to simulate how scientists study and interact with these fascinating creatures. 
Consider the following scenario: scientists want to provide food and tools to the penguins, but there aren't always enough scientists around to man the stations. So they have asked us to help build a multi agent system that will monitor how the penguins use these resources. This helps them understand penguin behavior and ensure everyone gets a fair share."
