# Exercise 1: Multi-Agent Architecture Design
Suggested Extensions, Pick One or Mix
1. Add a "Translation Verification Agent"
This agent checks if the translation preserves meaning/cultural context.

Comes after the language specialist and before the response goes to the user.

2. Add a "Multimodal Media Tool"
A tool that retrieves images/audio relevant to the query (e.g., a sound clip of a traditional song or image of a local artifact).

Connects to both the language specialist and the knowledge base.

3. Add a "Feedback Collector"
Captures user feedback after receiving information.

Helps improve future responses and tracks which areas need more detail or clarification.

4. Add a "Cultural Sensitivity Checker" Tool
Ensures that knowledge being returned is appropriate to share (some Indigenous knowledge is restricted or sacred).
