# Demo Script: Uluru Cultural Center Language Interaction Demo

**(Introduction - Setting the Stage)**

G'day! Today, we're going on a journey to Uluru, the heart of Australia, and exploring a fascinating way that technology can help make spaces more accessible for all. 

Did you know that Australia has hundreds of Indigenous languages, each a unique treasure trove of history, knowledge, and cultural identity? Sadly, many of these languages are endangered. Some have very few speakers left. This is not just a linguistic loss; it's a loss of cultural heritage, of stories, songs, and ways of understanding the world. We're talking about the loss of knowledge of the land, of the stars, of everything."

The Uluru-Kata Tjuta Cultural Center is a place where visitors from all over the world come to learn about the indigenous cultures of Australia. Imagine a time in the future where visitors to this cultural center could engage in material created or tailored to their own language. For many of these endangered languages. At present, a cultural center may not have the funding or resources to do this on their own, but LLMs can help to bridge that gap.

Imagine a visitor who speaks only Arrernte. If they were to want to learn more about other indigenous groups at the cultural center, they would normally have to just learn another language (likely English) to interact with the material.

That's where AI can come in! Large Language Models trained on endangered languages can help to keep these languages alive and to grow. In the case of the cultural center, such a system could enable individuals to feel that they can still navigate and learn about the world without needing to do so in a language that is not their own.
While such models are not yet available and researchers are still working on developing them, we can start to think about how we could set up a multi-agent AI system that could help them implement a system like this.
