# Routing and Data Flow in Agentic Systems Exercises

This directory contains exercises focused on implementing effective routing and data flow mechanisms in multi-agent systems.

## Exercise Overview

In these exercises, you'll learn to create robust routing and data flow architectures by:

1. Implementing intelligent request routing between agents
2. Managing data transformations between agent components
3. Creating flexible pipelines for information processing
4. Handling complex routing scenarios and edge cases

## Key Concepts

- Request routing patterns and strategies
- Data transformation and normalization
- Pipeline design for agent systems
- Conditional routing and adaptive workflows

## Exercise Structure

The exercises provide scaffolding code that you'll extend to create effective routing mechanisms:
