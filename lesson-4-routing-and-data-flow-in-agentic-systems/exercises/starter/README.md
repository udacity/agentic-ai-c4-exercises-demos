## EXERCISE: Enhanced Request Routing with Urgency Detection

In this exercise, you'll add an urgency detection feature to the Chinese Postal Bank system.
When customers have urgent requests, they should be handled with higher priority and routed
appropriately.

Your task is to:
1. Create a UrgencyDetector agent that analyzes if a request is urgent
2. Update the BookingManager to track and prioritize urgent requests
3. Modify the main agent workflow to include urgency detection before service routing
4. Ensure urgent requests receive proper handling and are tracked in metrics

This exercise will strengthen your understanding of multi-agent coordination and data
