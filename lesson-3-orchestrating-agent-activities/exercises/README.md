# Orchestrating Agent Activities Exercises

This directory contains exercises focused on orchestrating activities across multiple agents to create coordinated multi-agent systems.

## Exercise Overview

In these exercises, you'll learn how to effectively orchestrate multiple agents by:

1. Creating orchestration patterns for agent coordination
2. Implementing workflow management between agents
3. Handling dependencies and sequencing of agent activities
4. Managing cross-cutting concerns across multiple agents

## Key Concepts

- Orchestration patterns and architectures
- Workflow management and sequencing
- Error handling and recovery in multi-agent systems
- Resource allocation and prioritization

## Exercise Structure

The exercises provide scaffolding code that you'll extend to create effective orchestration mechanisms:

```
