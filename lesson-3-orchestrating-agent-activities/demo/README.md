Hello everyone, and welcome! Today, we're going to be diving into further learning about how to orchestrate agent activities. 
To do so, consider the following: 
In Nairobi, Kenya, an entrepreneur is thinking of opening a new Skate Park with an attached shop. The complex will be called "Skate State". They have
come to you to ask for some help as they want to simulate the operations of the park and shop using a system of agents.

So, let's create a system to help manage a Skate Park and Shop. Think about it: taking bookings for skate sessions, managing the shop's inventory of skateboards and gear, handling customer inquiries... It's a great challenge, right? And that's what we're going to explore in this demo."
