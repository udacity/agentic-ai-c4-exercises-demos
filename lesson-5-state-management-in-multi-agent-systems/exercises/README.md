# State Management in Multi-Agent Systems Exercises

This directory contains exercises focused on implementing effective state management strategies in multi-agent systems.

## Exercise Overview

In these exercises, you'll learn to create robust state management mechanisms by:

1. Implementing different state storage and sharing patterns
2. Managing consistency across distributed agent states
3. Creating transactional workflows that maintain system integrity
4. Handling concurrent state access and modifications

## Key Concepts

- State storage and sharing mechanisms
- Consistency models for distributed agent systems
- Transactional operations and rollbacks
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Exercise Structure

The exercises provide scaffolding code that you'll extend to create effective state management systems:
