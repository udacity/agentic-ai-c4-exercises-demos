EXERCISE: Transaction History State Management

In this exercise, you'll extend the Colombian Fruit Market system by implementing
a purchase history tracking feature. This represents a practical extension of state
management that's common in real e-commerce systems.

You'll need to:
1. Add a purchase_fruit tool to record transactions
2. Track purchase dates and quantities
3. Add a view_purchase_history tool
4. Implement purchase summary functionality
5. Make the FruitAdvisorAgent aware of purchase history

This exercise demonstrates how state management can be extended to handle
complex transaction data while maintaining user context across sessions.
